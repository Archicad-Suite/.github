## 🎯 What You Get
🏗️ **True BIM Workflow**: Work with intelligent, parametric building objects (walls, windows, slabs) that carry rich data and automatically update across plans, sections, and elevations.
🎨 **Integrated Design & Visualization**: Seamlessly transition from conceptual massing and 3D modeling to high-quality rendering and virtual reality walkthroughs within the same environment.
📄 **Automated Documentation**: Generate consistent, coordinated construction drawings, schedules, and quantity take-offs directly from the virtual building model.

## About Archicad
Archicad, developed by Graphisoft, is a pioneering and industry-respected Building Information Modeling (BIM) software created specifically for architects and designers. It enables professionals to design buildings using a virtual model constructed of intelligent elements that contain real-world information. This "virtual building" approach means that every change made in a 3D view is automatically reflected in all 2D drawings, schedules, and views, ensuring consistency and dramatically reducing errors during the documentation phase. Archicad is renowned for its user-friendly interface and powerful design tools that support creative freedom while enforcing the rigorous standards required for technical construction documentation.

As one of the first BIM applications on the market, Archicad has a long history of innovation, particularly in fostering collaborative workflows. Its flagship teamwork solution allows multiple architects to work on the same shared project model simultaneously, even in remote locations, greatly enhancing coordination and efficiency. The software supports open standards like IFC (Industry Foundation Classes), ensuring smooth data exchange with engineers, consultants, and other stakeholders using different software. From initial sketches and energy analysis to detailed construction documents and facility management data delivery, Archicad provides a comprehensive, architect-centric platform for managing the entire lifecycle of a building project.
